<!--
|    This plugin will kick and private message players.
|    It will check every 30 seconds (set it with 'interval') the players who have a ping 
|    above 100 (set it with 'max_ping') and a level lower or equal to 1 (set it with 'max_level_checked').
|    
|    The first time a ping is too high the message 'first_ping_warning' gets send to him (personal).
|    Every next time (untill kick time) the message 'reminder_ping_warning' gets send to him (personal).
|    When the player gets kicked, the message 'public_ping_kick_message' gets send (public).
